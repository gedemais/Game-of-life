#GAME OF THE LIFE

Inspired by John Conway ;)

The Game of Life is not your typical computer game. It is a 'cellular automaton', 
and was invented by Cambridge mathematician John Conway.
This game became widely known when it was mentioned in an article published by 
Scientific American in 1970. It consists of a collection of cells which, based 
on a few mathematical rules, can live, die or multiply. Depending on the initial 
conditions, the cells form various patterns throughout the course of the game.


Just do a make, then launch the file "jdlv" with the following parameters : 

The size of the square map 
The filling rate of cells at start
The time in seconds between each cycles
The time in nanoseconds between each cycles
The maximum number of cycles

Have fun ! ;)
